# Optical-Comm-ML
Machine learning for optical communication over a dispersive fiber

The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques to classify a distorted signal into a digital signal.

Support vector machines: 
The time-domain signal is partitioned into sets of samples based on the bit rate. The SVM is trained on the samples after they have been cast as 16-dimensional feature vectors, where each dimension is a sample within the clock cycle.
