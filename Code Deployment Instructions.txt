Code Deployment Instructions

Gaussian Radial Basis Kernel files
kernelbin_SVM.m -this function contains the RBF kernel code for binary data training and testing
kernelpam_SVM.m -this function contains the RBF kernel code for 4PAM data training and testing
kernelfindparam.m -m file that deploys the binary kernel. Oneshot variable determines if a tuning sweep is to be performed using variable vectors, otherwise the function will be run once with our default tuned values.
kernelfindparampam.m  -m file that deploys the 4PAM kernel.
