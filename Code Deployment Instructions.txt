Code Deployment Instructions

Feature Extraction files
auto_labeler.m - run program to generate label file from TX file
data_parser.m - function to parse RX and label files into training and test arrays

Support Vector Machine files
SVM_train.m - function to train an SVM hyperplane using training array and hyperparameters
SVM_test.m - function to test an SVM hyperplane using test array and hyperparameters
test_desynch.m - run program to test the effects of desynchronization
test_regularizer.m - run program to test soft-margin SVM

Gaussian Radial Basis Kernel files
kernelbin_SVM.m -this function contains the RBF kernel code for binary data training and testing
kernelpam_SVM.m -this function contains the RBF kernel code for 4PAM data training and testing
kernelfindparam.m -m file that deploys the binary kernel. Oneshot variable determines if a tuning sweep is to be performed using variable vectors, otherwise the function will be run once with our default tuned values.
kernelfindparampam.m  -m file that deploys the 4PAM kernel.
